# Introductions

DevOps is one of the hottest buzzwords in tech now, although it is much more than buzz. It is a collaboration between the development and operations team, where they work together to deliver a product faster and efficiently. In the past few years, there has been a tremendous increase in job listings for DevOps engineers. Multinational companies, like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, frequently have multiple open positions for DevOps engineer Experts. However, the job market is highly competitive, and the questions asked in a DevOps engineer interview can cover a lot of challenging subjects. 

If you’ve completed your DevOps Course and started to prepare for development and operations roles in the IT industry, you know it’s a challenging field that will take some real preparation to break into. Here are some of the most common DevOps interview questions and answers that can help you while you prepare for DevOps roles in the industry.

You might be among the developers who are planning to advance your career as a DevOps engineer, analyst, or specialist. Besides the required technical skills, a DevOps job interview can be tough without diligent preparation. 

This repositories post presents more than tools of the most common DevOps interview questions, neatly broken out into themes, so you can ace your next interview and successfully get that dream job.
